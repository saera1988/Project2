## Describe how it is work (logic behind )

I used 7 component (pages):
* App component(main (parenat)page that)
* Home(act as the landing page and display a message to the user.)
* nav bar(acts as the navigational bar for the application using bootstrab templet and React-router react-router-dom)
* water(parent component for water with all function needed ,add,clear,edit,progress)
* WaterDrink(incloude form takeing info from user and submit it to Water cupe to be added ther  to the list )
* WaterCup (include 3 button linked to the function on water and display the list taking item form user send from Waterdrink)
* Fitness(use api to display weather ,linked the info provied by api and make if statment with 3 stat and desplay message according to the info from api)
 
 ## problems and solving strategy:
Api :Difficulties with finding a good api provide me with information about ative level or type of workout and the amount of calories was burned.I've tried many then it end up with using weather api and change the plan to determain the place for exersies accoording to weather condation and local tempreture.

## Status:

## List unsolved problems :
* Api not working after deployement ,but it work localy.
